# Architecting Angular Applications with Redux, RxJs, and NgRx
This is the code repository for [Architecting Angular Applications with Redux, RxJs, and NgRx](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/architecting-angular-applications-redux?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787122406), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book starts with a retrospective look at the way we built apps in AngularJS. We also look at the one-way data flow and Flux pattern with concepts such as dispatcher, action, stores, and controller views. Learn to structure your async code and see how to model and manipulate streams and values over time. Additionally, you will get familiar with the basics of RxJS and later explore advanced operators like Subjects, Schedulers, error handling, testing, and tools. You will not only get to know the Redux pattern but also understand when and why you need it. Toward the end, you will realize why ngrx and Angular go so well together. You will also see how to debug your application with selected tools as well as test different facets of your app.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Added redame file in every program which will guide the steps to run the program

The code will look like the following:
```
interface IPrinter {
  print(IPrintable printable);
}
```

This book is about building Angular applications using NGRX. To get the most out of the book you need a basic understanding of the Angular framework and should be able to scaffold an Angular application using the Angular-CLI or be able to set up an Angular project through Webpack, if that is your preferred way. It's good to have a decent understanding of JavaScript and TypeScript. Most of all a curious mind is really all you need. It's a good idea to have NodeJs installed on your machine.
